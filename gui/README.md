## security
For security, we use a file, `config.json` on each local machine to hold the IP address and user data.  You should create this file for each machine with the following format:
```
{
    "cage_host":"999.999.999.999",
    "db_name":"name_of_the_database", 
    "user": "user_name_here", 
    "password":"user_password_here",
}
```
